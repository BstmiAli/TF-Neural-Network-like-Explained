# A TensorFlow-Alike Neural Network Explained
This repository is intended to comment on some points that I've found ambiguous when I was learning TensorFlow, hopfully that will help other people whom might encounter the same difficulties.

The Neural Network used in this repository is radically simlified, the main purpose is to get your brain around the core ideas behind TensorFlow.

The materials used in this repository are published on the Internet, I DO NOT CLAIM THE OWNERSHIP OF ANY OF THEM!
